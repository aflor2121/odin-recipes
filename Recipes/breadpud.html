    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Bread pudding is a bread-based dessert popular in many countries' cuisines, made with stale bread and milk or cream, generally containing eggs, a form of fat such as oil, butter or suet, and depending on whether the pudding is sweet or savory, a variety of other ingredients.</p>
    <p>Sweet bread puddings may use sugar, syrup, honey, dried fruit, nuts, as well as spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, or vanilla.</p>
    <p>The bread is soaked in the liquids, mixed with the other ingredients, and baked.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <p> 1 loaf day old Challah Bread- cubed</p></li>
        <li> <p> 5 large eggs lightly beaten</p> </li>
        <li> <p> 1 cup granulated sugar</p> </li>
        <li> <p> 4 cups whole milk </p> </li>
        <li> <p> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</p> </li>
        <li> <p> 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg </p> </li>
        <li> <p> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon </p> </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <p> Spray a 9x13 baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Place the cubed challah bread into the prepared baking dish and spread it around into an even layer. Set aside. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> In a very large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, milk, vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon until fully combined. Pour the mixture evenly over the bread in the prepared baking pan, making sure all of the bread is coated. Allow to sit and soak up the mixture for about 15 minutes.</p> </li>
        <li> <p> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Once the 15 minutes is over, place the bread pudding in the oven and bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until the top is set.</p> </li>
        <li> <p> Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.</p> </li>
