    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Authentic Italian Gelato is a frozen creamy dessert made with milk, heavy cream and sugar. 
    <p> With or without eggs (depending on the taste), you can make dense creamy gelato at home, following a slow freezing/creaming process, usually with the help of an ice cream maker.</p>   
    <p> Gelato in Italy is a true passion and a very rooted tradition. You can find Gelato on sale in many shops called “Gelateria” present in large quantities in all Italian cities, even in the smallest ones.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <p> 4 medium egg yolks </p> </li>
        <li> <p> 150 g of granulated sugar </p> </li>
        <li> <p> 350 ml of whole milk </p> </li>
        <li> <p> 250 ml of heavy cream </p> </li>
        <li> <p> A little grated lemon zest or vanilla extract </p> </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whip the egg yolks with the sugar at maximum speed for about 5 minutes, until you have a soft fluffy cream.</li>
        <li><p>Meanwhile, pour the milk in a saucepan and bring it almost to a boil. Cook for about 5 minutes. <strong>Do not let it boil!</strong></p></li>
        <li><p>At this step, transfer the egg and sugar fluffy cream to a saucepan. Pour the hot milk slowly. Keep mixing while you do it. In this way you are also pasteurizing the eggs. If you want to flavor your gelato, this is the time to add either grated lemon zest or two drops of vanilla extract or vanilla bean.</p> </li>
        <li><p>Now put it back on the heat and cook for another 5 minutes. <strong>Without boiling and always stirring!</strong> Then turn off the heat and add the cold heavy cream. Mix really well.</p></li>
        <li><p> Lastly, pour the mixture into the machine and start it. It will take about 40 minutes, depending on the model. After the necessary time, your gelato is ready! Fresh, creamy and nutritious.</p></li>
